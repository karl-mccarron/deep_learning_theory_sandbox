# Principles of Deep Learning Sandbox

This repository is a sandbox for me to document my thoughts with the text [Principles of Deep Learning Theory](https://deeplearningtheory.com/).

I believe that the text offers a potentially insightful lens with which to analyse neural networks from a theoretical perspective. This is my journey through these texts to perform experiments verifying some of the claims derived in the book. It will also be my source of record for thoughts on what the book claims, and where I think further thought is needed to understand the model it has created.

##Â Repo Layout

This repo consists of Python notebooks, 1 for each chapter of interest. These notebooks will contain my code validating some of the mathematical derivations made in the book. This will be done using the Pytorch framework to construct the models (which will offer a good opportunity to improve my experience with `pytorch` as well).
